## 1. Introduction to Python

Python is a versatile, easy-to-learn, and high-level programming language. It is widely used in web development, data analysis, machine learning, and many other fields. In this guide, we’ll cover the basics of Python to get you started on your programming journey.

### Why Python?
- Easy to learn syntax
- Versatile and widely used
- Excellent support for data science, AI, and web development

## 2. Setting Up Python

Before you start coding, you need to install Python on your machine.

### Steps to Install Python:
1. Download the latest version of Python from the official website: [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Follow the installation instructions based on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. After installation, verify it by typing python --version in your terminal or command prompt.

### Optional: Install an IDE
To make coding easier, you can use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

## 3. Basic Syntax and Data Types

Python’s syntax is clean and easy to understand.

### Hello World Program:
```python
print("Hello, World!")

Variables and Data Types:

int: Whole numbers (e.g., 5, 100)

float: Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, 10.0)

str: String (text) (e.g., "Hello", 'Python')

bool: Boolean values (True or False)


Example:

x = 5   # int
y = 3.14  # float
name = "Alice"  # str
is_student = True  # bool


---

4. Control Flow

Control flow allows you to make decisions in your code.

Conditional Statements:

age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")

Loops:

for loop:


for i in range(5):
    print(i)

while loop:


i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1


---

5. Functions and Modules

Functions allow you to organize your code and avoid repetition.

Defining a Function:

def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

Calling the Function:

greet("Alice")

Using Modules:

You can import external Python modules (libraries) to extend functionality.

import math
print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0


---

6. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP helps you model real-world objects and interactions. In Python, you can create classes and objects.

Example:

class Person:
    def _init_(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")

# Creating an object
person1 = Person("Alice", 25)
person1.greet()  # Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 25 years old.


---

7. Data Structures

Python provides several built-in data structures.

List: Ordered, mutable collection


fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

Tuple: Ordered, immutable collection


coordinates = (1, 2)

Dictionary: Key-value pairs


person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}

Set: Unordered, no duplicate items


unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3}


---

8. Libraries and Frameworks

Python has many libraries for various tasks. Here are some popular ones:

NumPy: For numerical computations

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib: For plotting and visualization

Django/Flask: For web development


You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib django flask


---

9. Projects to Practice

Practice is key to learning. Here are some beginner projects:

1. Calculator: Build a simple calculator.


2. To-Do List: Create a to-do list app with options to add/remove tasks.


3. Number Guessing Game: Write a program where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.
