### 2. Setting Up Your Environment
1. *Download Python*:
   - Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads) and download the latest version for your operating system.
2. *Install an IDE*:
   - Recommended IDEs:
     - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
     - [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
     - [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)
3. *Verify Installation*:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt and type:
     bash
     python --version
     
     If Python is installed, it will show the version number.

### 3. Python Basics
1. *Variables and Data Types*:
   - Store and manipulate data:
     python
     name = "Alice"
     age = 30
     height = 5.5  # in feet
     
2. *Input and Output*:
   - Use input() for user input and print() to display output:
     python
     name = input("Enter your name: ")
     print("Hello, " + name)
     
3. *Basic Syntax*:
   - Python uses indentation instead of braces:
     python
     if age > 18:
         print("You are an adult.")
     
4. *Operators*:
   - Arithmetic (+, -, *, /), comparison (==, !=, <, >), logical (and, or, not).

### 4. Control Flow
1. *Conditional Statements*:
   - if, elif, and else for decision-making:
     python
     if age < 18:
         print("Minor")
     elif age == 18:
         print("Just turned adult!")
     else:
         print("Adult")
     
2. *Loops*:
   - for loop for iterating over a sequence:
     python
     for i in range(5):
         print(i)
     
   - while loop for repeated execution:
     python
     count = 0
     while count < 5:
         print(count)
         count += 1
     
3. *Break and Continue*:
   - Use break to exit and continue to skip to the next iteration.

### 5. Functions
1. *Defining Functions*:
   - Use the def keyword:
     python
     def greet(name):
         return f"Hello, {name}"
     
2. *Arguments and Return Values*:
   - Example:
     python
     def add(a, b):
         return a + b
     print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8
     
3. *Lambda Functions*:
   - Anonymous functions:
     python
     square = lambda x: x**2
     print(square(5))  # Output: 25

### 6. Data Structures
1. *Lists*:
   - Ordered collections:
     python
     fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
     
2. *Tuples*:
   - Immutable sequences:
     python
     point = (10, 20)
     
3. *Dictionaries*:
   - Key-value pairs:
     python
     student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 22}
     
4. *Sets*:
   - Unordered unique elements:
     python
     unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3}
     

**[Detailed Understanding of Data Structures](https://realpython.com/python-data-structures/)**

---

### 7. Object-Oriented Programming
1. *Classes and Objects*:
   - Example:
     python
     class Car:
         def __init__(self, brand, model):
             self.brand = brand
             self.model = model

## 8. File Handling
File handling in Python allows you to interact with files on your system, enabling operations such as reading, writing, and appending data. Here are some common file handling operations in Python:

### Code Examples:
- *Reading from a File*:
  ```python
  with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
      content = file.read()
      print(content)

Writing to a File:

with open("file.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")

## 9. Error and Exception Handling

Exception handling allows you to manage errors and exceptions, preventing your program from crashing unexpectedly. It helps ensure that errors are caught and handled gracefully.

### Code Examples:
Try-Except Block:
try:
    x = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")

Finally Block:

try:
    x = 10 / 2
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
finally:
    print("This will always run.")

## 10. Modules and Libraries

Python provides a rich set of built-in modules and libraries. You can extend your Python programs by importing these modules, and you can also install third-party libraries to expand functionality.

### Code Examples:

Using a Built-in Module:

import math
print(math.sqrt(16))

Installing External Libraries: To install external libraries, use the pip package manager:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
